201 court costs. When the social media platform's failure to comply

204 conduct, punitive damages may be assessed against the social
205 media platform.
206 (6)(a) A social media platform that knowingly or
207 recklessly violates subsection (2), subsection (3), or, if in
208 effect, subsection (4) is liable to the minor account holder,

214 (c) Any action brought under this subsection may only be
215 brought on behalf of a minor account holder.
216 (7) For purposes of bringing an action under this section,
217 a social media platform that allows a minor account holder

220 considered to be both engaged in substantial and not isolated

231 complaints, the department has reason to believe that an entity
232 or person has engaged in, or is engaging in, an act or practice
233 that violates this section, the department may administer oaths
234 and affirmations, subpoena witnesses or matter, and collect
235 evidence. Within 5 days, excluding weekends and legal holidays,
236 after the service of a subpoena or at any time before the return
237 date specified therein, whichever is longer, the party served
238 may file in the circuit court in the county in which it resides
239 or in which it transacts business and serve upon the enforcing
240 authority a petition for an order modifying or setting aside the
241 subpoena. The petitioner may raise any objection or privilege
242 which would be available upon service of such subpoena in a
243 civil action. The subpoena shall inform the party served of its
244 rights under this subsection.

246 subpoena is located outside the state, the entity or person
247 subpoenaed may make it available to the department or its
248 representative to examine the matter at the place where it is
249 located. The department may designate representatives, including
250 officials of the state in which the matter is located, to

252 requests from officials of other states.
253 (c) Upon failure of an entity or person without lawful
254 excuse to obey a subpoena and upon reasonable notice to all
255 persons affected, the department may apply to the circuit court
256 for an order compelling compliance.
257 (d) The department may request that an entity or person
258 that refuses to comply with a subpoena on the ground that
259 testimony or matter may incriminate the entity or person be
260 ordered by the court to provide the testimony or matter. Except
261 in a prosecution for perjury, an entity or individual that
262 complies with a court order to provide testimony or matter after
263 asserting a valid privilege against self-incrimination shall not
264 have the testimony or matter so provided, or evidence derived
265 therefrom, received against the entity or person in any criminal
266 investigation or proceeding.

272 under this part or who removes from any place, conceals,
273 withholds, mutilates, alters, or destroys, or by any other means
274 falsifies any documentary material in the possession, custody,

401 (7) This section does not preclude any other available
402 remedy at law or equity.
403 (8)(a) If, by its own inquiry or as a result of
404 complaints, the department has reason to believe that an entity
405 or person has engaged in, or is engaging in, an act or practice
406 that violates this section, the department may administer oaths
407 and affirmations, subpoena witnesses or matter, and collect
408 evidence. Within 5 days, excluding weekends and legal holidays,
409 after the service of a subpoena or at any time before the return
410 date specified therein, whichever is longer, the party served
411 may file in the circuit court in the county in which it resides
412 or in which it transacts business and serve upon the enforcing
413 authority a petition for an order modifying or setting aside the
414 subpoena. The petitioner may raise any objection or privilege
415 which would be available upon service of such subpoena in a
416 civil action. The subpoena shall inform the party served of its
417 rights under this subsection.

419 subpoena is located outside the state, the entity or person
420 subpoenaed may make it available to the department or its
421 representative to examine the matter at the place where it is
422 located. The department may designate representatives, including
423 officials of the state in which the matter is located, to
424 inspect the matter on its behalf, and may respond to similar

434 in a prosecution for perjury, an entity or individual that
435 complies with a court order to provide testimony or matter after
436 asserting a valid privilege against self-incrimination shall not
437 have the testimony or matter so provided, or evidence derived
438 therefrom, received against the entity or person in any criminal
439 investigation or proceeding.
